# SpeechEmotionRecognition

## Abstract:

Using RAVDESS dataset which contains  around 1500 audio file inputs from 24 different actors (12 male and 12 female ) who recorded short audios in 8 different emotions, we will train a NLP- based model which will be able to detect among the 8 basic emotions as well as the gender of the speaker i.e. Male voice or Female voice.  
After training we can deploy this model for predicting with live voices.

## Deliverables:

Learn the basics of Python, ML/DL, NLP, librosa, sklearn, etc , Literature Review , analyzing the dataset and 
Feature extraction. Building and training the model on the training data, followed by testing on test data. And 
finally, testing the model on live audio input (unseen) and collecting the results:)
